- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by actively engaging with stakeholders and gathering feedback, which helps me understand their requirements and expectations. Creating “user stories” simplifies this process by framing user needs in an easy-to-understand and prioritize format. User stories clarify the features users want, making it easier to implement those features in the program.

- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs involves iterative development, where I build and test features little by little. This allows for frequent adjustments based on feedback. In the future, I aim to incorporate Agile processes like Scrum for team collaboration and Kanban for managing workflow. These methods promote flexibility and continuous improvement.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
Being a good team member means communicating openly, sharing knowledge, and being receptive to feedback. It involves collaboration and supporting colleagues to achieve common goals. I feel it is important to take responsibility for my tasks and contribute in a positive way to the team dynamic.
